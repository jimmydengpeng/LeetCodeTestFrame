# LeetCodeTestFrame
A framework for testing C/C++ LeetCode solution codes in local machines.

I come up this idea when I am submitting my code for solving LeetCode problems online. What if I can test my solution codes in my own machine and use commandline options to test various functions? So I want write such a framework that helps testing codes from scratch.
