# LeetCodeTestFrame
A framework for testing C/C++ LeetCode solution codes in local machines.

 I came up this idea when I was submitting my code for solving LeetCode problems online. What if I could test my solution codes in my own machine and use commandline options to test various functions? So I decided to write such a framework that helps testing codes from scratch.
